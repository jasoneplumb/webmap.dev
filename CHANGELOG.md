# Changelog

## v0.5.0-beta (2026-03-31)

### Features

- **GPX export** — track is automatically downloaded as a GPX 1.1 file when recording is stopped; filename includes start date/time (#41)

### Fixes

- **Search** — spinner now resolves on results/error; pressing Enter submits the query instead of collapsing the control (#40)
- **iOS locate** — removed racy `permissions.query` check that caused the first Locate tap to fail with a false "access denied" (#38)
- **Map layers** — restored missing dropped-pin marker icon; default layer changed to Streets; layer labels renamed to Structures and Topo (#37)

## v0.4.0-beta (2026-03-31)

### Features

- **UI controls** — relocated controls from bottom-right to top-left for better thumb reach on mobile
- **Version badge** — version overlay displayed in upper-right corner of the map (#20)

### Fixes

- **iOS user gestures** — GPS and clipboard operations now execute within the user gesture to avoid Safari's permission expiry (#25, #26)
- **iOS GPS permission** — location request now occurs directly inside user gesture handler (#23)
- **Record button** — disabled when location is not enabled to prevent invalid state (#24)
- **Clipboard copy** — reverse geocode clipboard copy no longer fails due to expired user gesture

## v0.3.0-beta (2026-03-18)

### Features

- **Location button** — three-state locate button (off / following / passive) with blue pulsing dot, accuracy circle, and graceful GPS signal loss handling (#12)
- **Enhanced search** — throttled autocomplete (3 chars, 250ms debounce), viewport-biased results, draggable reverse-geocode pin, flyTo animation, right-click/long-press support (#11)
- **Track recording** — start/pause/resume/stop state machine with confirmation, real-time stats overlay (time, distance, speed), styled trail with glow and direction arrows (#13)
- **Mobile bottom sheet** — three-snap-point bottom sheet (peek/half/full) on mobile, side panel on desktop, for search results and reverse geocode info (#14)
- **Map interaction polish** — fractional zoom (`zoomSnap: 0`), smooth scroll-zoom, `flyTo` animations for all programmatic transitions, mobile-optimized control layout (#16)
- **Service Worker** — `vite-plugin-pwa` with Workbox; app shell cached (CacheFirst), map tiles cached (StaleWhileRevalidate, 500 entries/30 days), geocoding API NetworkOnly, offline banner (#15)
- **Canvas renderer** — `preferCanvas: true`, `keepBuffer: 3`, `updateWhenZooming: false` on tile layers, `idle.ts` utility for debounced map events (#10)
- **Vite + TypeScript** — modernized build toolchain with Vite 5, strict TypeScript, ESLint 9, and CI/CD pipeline

### Fixes

- **Search bar** — silent API key failure now warns in console; `useMapBounds` disabled at low zoom levels to prevent empty results (#18)
- **CI** — corrected branch trigger (`main` → `mainline`), deploy SSH key secret name, and enforced LF line endings for shell scripts
